 Short Summary
 ---
 
 As a Nigerian Developer you might want to search for Developers in your state of residence for several reasons. Setting an example from myself, starting out as a developer wasn’t that easy for me because I didn’t really understand the structured part I needed to take in order to become a professional;
 
 sometimes we run into issues, we go on stack-overflow and we find answers to the problems we have been facing, but other times we don’t just understand the right steps to take to fixing problems that are specific the exact issues we are facing, Hence the need for the physical presence or personal mentorship of a more experienced developer. This is where GitNaija comes in.
 
GitNaija is a Native Android app that helps Developers find and contact other developers on github with specific set of skills in specific regions in Nigeria to enhance one on one software development mentorships, to and building of tech teams.
